Introduction

	This document describes the tasks to be performed for, and the constituents
of the Deliverable 1. Such a document would usually not exist in a real
project documentation. (Similar information would be found elsewhere, for
example, in the Iteration Plan document, however.)

		[Note:]	Do not edit or modify this document. This document is
				managed by your lecturer.


Goals

	Deliverable 1 simulates the very first sprint according to Scrum. Hence,
the project finds itself in a very early stage of the whole development process.
An initial version of the project's {{{../vision.html}Vision}} document exists only.

	The goals of the provisioning of Deliverable 1 are:

	* To think about stakeholders;

	* To think about and articulate first and most important user stories;

	* To think about and illustrate a domain model.

	[]


Your Tasks

	Besides setting up your infrastructure (according to instructions given
by the lecturer), you work on the Deliverable 1. The constituents of D1
(short for Deliverable 1) are:

	[[1]]	A list of stakeholders; format: Name and
			brief description. Recommended place: the {{{../glossary.html}Glossary}}.

	[[]]	An initial set of user stories.


	[[]]	A context (use case) diagram.

	[[]]	A domain model. Domain classes (name, a few attributes at most, no
			operations), associations and multiplicities. No navigabilities.

	[[]]	A glossary.

	[]


Components of this Deliverable

	Your deliverable will consist of your committed project on the Git master
branch. You will merge the deliverable from you development branch <sprint1>
(or <s1> if you prefer) to the master branch and tag it <d1>.

	The constituents of your D1 shall consist of:

	[[1]]	A document consisting of:

			* The user stories;
			
			* The context diagramm.

	[[]]	A set of stakeholders, preferably in the {{{../glossary.html}Glossary}}.

	[[]]	A Domain Model document (title, brief introduction, and the domain model).

Distribution of points for this deliverable.

	Ideally, the (extension of the) glossary, the document with the User stories and the
Domain Model Document is well integrated into the project documentation.
If you don't use APT, then PDF files will do as well.


Deadline

	This deliverable is due: TBD.
